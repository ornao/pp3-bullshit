## About

This is a command-line version of the bluff card game Bullshit for 3 players. Many versions of this game exist and the classic game is best player in a group of people. 

The classic game generally have no rules and players can discard cards to communal pile in any order with any amount of matching cards. To add order to game, I added a question to get rid of certain card number each turn. 

The objective of the game is to be the first one to get rid of all your cards.

## Bugs
| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ------- | ------- |
| 
menu_select() bug: This function was not executing its if or else ==1,2 when incorrect value enter first followed by 1 or 2. | Fixed by setting the start_option_selected variable to input() to get the user's input and using this in loop rather than other value. See [commit ea2de49](https://github.com/ornao/pp3-bullshit/commit/ea2de49f39f90ae87ef3a2644ee9e6bde323bb87) for further details. |
